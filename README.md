At Ã‰cole 42, there are specialized C++ modules aimed at enhancing students' proficiency in the C++ programming language.
These modules typically encompass the following areas:

Advanced Programming:
The C++ modules cover advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming, classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management.

C++ Standard Library (STL):
Students learn to utilize the C++ STL, which provides ready-to-use data structures and algorithms like vectors, lists, stacks, and queues.

C++ Application Development:
Modules often include the creation of complete C++ applications, including projects that implement the learned concepts.

Optimization and Performance:
Students are introduced to code optimization techniques to enhance the performance of their C++ applications.

Teamwork:
Collaboration and teamwork are strongly encouraged within these modules, with students collaborating on complex C++ projects.

Testing and Debugging:
Students gain knowledge of testing and debugging techniques to ensure the reliability of their programs.

These modules are designed to solidify students' understanding of C++ and enable them to develop advanced programming skills. 
They are often pursued by students who have already completed the C++ pool to further deepen their knowledge and expertise in this programming language.
